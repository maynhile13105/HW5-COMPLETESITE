I made these changes to fix the CSS bugs on the small screen because when I implemented it, I used the large screen so I did not recognize the bugs until I used my laptop.

Also, I added the hover for the sections in the persona so that users can read the contents inside each section easier because the size is bigger (I zoomed in the section when it is hover).

I added the theme button to all pages so that users can keep the same theme on all pages when users try to switch to different pages.
